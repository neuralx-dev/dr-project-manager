# Product Requirements Document: Telegram Project Management Bot

## Introduction/Overview

The Telegram Project Management Bot is a lightweight, effective project management solution that operates directly within Telegram, eliminating the need for users to switch between multiple applications. This bot enables users to create and manage projects, organize tasks within sections, track progress, and collaborate with team members seamlessly through Telegram's interface.

**Problem Statement:** Teams, freelancers, and students need a simple yet effective way to manage projects without the complexity of traditional project management tools or the overhead of switching between communication and project management platforms.

**Goal:** Create a Telegram bot that provides essential project management functionality while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness for small teams.

## Goals

1. **Simplicity:** Provide core project management features without overwhelming complexity
2. **Accessibility:** Enable project management directly within Telegram messaging platform
3. **Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on projects with real-time updates
4. **Transparency:** Automatically notify team members of project changes via Telegram channels
5. **Efficiency:** Track project progress and task completion rates effectively

## User Stories

1. **As a freelancer,** I want to create projects for my clients so that I can organize my work by client and track progress.

2. **As a team lead,** I want to invite team members to projects so that everyone can see and update task statuses.

3. **As a project member,** I want to update task statuses using simple buttons so that I can quickly mark progress without typing complex commands.

4. **As a stakeholder,** I want to receive automatic updates in a Telegram channel so that I can stay informed about project progress without actively checking.

5. **As a student,** I want to track estimated vs actual time spent on tasks so that I can improve my time management skills.

6. **As a project manager,** I want to see overall project completion percentage so that I can quickly assess project status.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Project Management
1. Users must be able to create new projects with a name and description
2. Each project must support multiple sections for organizing tasks
3. Each section must support multiple tasks
4. Tasks must have three states: Todo, In Progress, Done
5. Users must be able to move tasks between states using interactive buttons

### Task Management
6. Tasks must store the following information:
   - Task name (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Assignee (optional)
   - Priority level (Low, Medium, High)
   - Estimated time (in hours)
   - Actual time spent (in hours)
   - Due date (optional)
   - Current state (Todo, In Progress, Done)

7. Users must be able to edit task details after creation
8. System must track when tasks change states and who made the changes

### User Management & Collaboration
9. Project creators must be able to invite other users to projects using Telegram user ID
10. Invited users must see shared projects in their bot interface
11. All project members must have equal access to view and modify tasks
12. System must display which user is assigned to each task

### Notifications & Updates
13. Bot must send notifications to a specified Telegram channel for all task state changes
14. Notifications must include: project name, task name, old state, new state, and user who made the change
15. Channel updates must be formatted clearly and include timestamps

### Bot Interface & Commands
16. Bot must support the following core commands:
    - `/create_project` - Create a new project
    - `/add_task` - Add a task to a project section
    - `/update_task` - Modify task details
    - `/invite_user` - Add a user to a project

17. Bot must use interactive keyboards and buttons for user interactions
18. Bot must provide inline keyboards for task state changes
19. Bot must display project and task lists in an organized, readable format

### Progress Tracking & Reporting
20. System must calculate and display project completion percentage
21. Progress must be calculated based on completed tasks vs total tasks
22. Users must be able to view project overview with progress indicators
23. System must track time spent vs estimated time per task

### Technical Requirements
24. Application must use Python as the programming language
25. Database must be SQLite for local storage
26. System must use a proper ORM for database management
27. Bot must handle concurrent users and multiple projects simultaneously
28. System must persist all data locally in SQLite database

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Complex Permissions:** Role-based access control or granular permissions
2. **Advanced Reporting:** Burndown charts, velocity tracking, or complex analytics
3. **File Attachments:** Uploading files or images to tasks
4. **Time Tracking UI:** Built-in timers or advanced time tracking interfaces
5. **Task Dependencies:** Tasks that depend on other tasks
6. **Project Templates:** Pre-defined project structures
7. **Integration:** Connecting with external tools or calendars
8. **Multi-language Support:** Localization beyond English
9. **Advanced Notifications:** Custom notification rules or scheduling
10. **Backup/Restore:** Data export/import functionality

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
- Use inline keyboards for quick task state changes
- Display project information in clear, hierarchical format
- Keep message formatting simple and readable
- Use emojis sparingly for status indicators (‚úÖ Done, üîÑ In Progress, ‚è≥ Todo)

### Database Schema (Suggested)
- **Projects:** id, name, description, creator_id, created_at, channel_id
- **Sections:** id, project_id, name, order
- **Tasks:** id, section_id, name, description, assignee_id, priority, estimated_hours, actual_hours, due_date, state, created_at, updated_at
- **ProjectMembers:** id, project_id, user_id, joined_at
- **TaskHistory:** id, task_id, user_id, old_state, new_state, changed_at

## Technical Considerations

1. **Telegram Bot Framework:** Use python-telegram-bot library for bot implementation
2. **ORM Recommendation:** SQLAlchemy for database operations
3. **Database Location:** Store SQLite file in application directory
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid user inputs and Telegram API errors
5. **State Management:** Use conversation handlers for multi-step operations
6. **Performance:** Index database tables appropriately for fast task lookups

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption:** Successfully handle multiple concurrent users and projects
2. **Functionality:** All core commands work reliably without errors
3. **Performance:** Bot responds to user interactions within 2 seconds
4. **Data Integrity:** No data loss or corruption during normal operations
5. **User Experience:** Users can complete basic project setup and task management within 5 minutes

## Open Questions

1. **Channel Configuration:** Should each project have its own notification channel, or should users specify the channel during project creation?
2. **User Discovery:** How should users find other team members' Telegram IDs for invitations?
3. **Data Limits:** Should there be limits on number of projects per user or tasks per project?
4. **Time Tracking:** Should actual time be manually entered or should the bot provide timing assistance?
5. **Notification Frequency:** Should there be any throttling of notifications to prevent channel spam?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic bot setup and command handling
- Project and task CRUD operations
- Simple task state management
- Basic database schema implementation

### Phase 2 (Core Features)
- User invitation and project sharing
- Interactive keyboards and buttons
- Channel notifications
- Progress tracking

### Phase 3 (Enhanced Features)
- Time tracking and estimation
- Priority levels
- Enhanced task details and editing
- Improved user interface and formatting
